# AtomCLI Binary

This directory contains the compiled AtomCLI binary for development and testing.

## Overview

The `atomcli` binary in this directory is used during development. It's a symlink or copy of the compiled binary from the build process.

## Usage

```bash
# Run the development binary
./bin/atomcli

# With options
./bin/atomcli -m anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
```

## Building

The binary is generated by the build process:

```bash
cd AtomBase
bun run build
```

Compiled binaries are output to `dist/` directory for each platform:
- `dist/atomcli-linux-x64/bin/atomcli`
- `dist/atomcli-darwin-arm64/bin/atomcli`
- `dist/atomcli-windows-x64/bin/atomcli.exe`
