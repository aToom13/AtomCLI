## OPENAI-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATIONS

### GPT Model Characteristics
GPT models (gpt-4, gpt-4o, o1, o3, o4-mini) have distinct behaviors:

**Standard GPT-4/4o:**
- Strong instruction following
- Good at structured outputs
- Reliable function calling

**o1/o3 Reasoning Models:**
- Extended reasoning capabilities
- Better for complex problem-solving
- May take longer but more accurate
- Use for architecture decisions, debugging

### Tool Usage
OpenAI function calling conventions:
- Use precise JSON schemas
- Include all required parameters
- Provide clear descriptions

### Response Format
- Markdown supported
- Structured JSON when requested
- Code blocks with language tags

### Token Efficiency
- Be concise in prompts
- Avoid unnecessary repetition
- Use efficient representation

### Multi-Turn Conversations
- Maintains good context
- Reference previous turns naturally
- Build on earlier responses

### Parallel Tool Calls
GPT models support parallel function calls:
- Use for independent operations
- Improve response latency
- Batch read operations when possible
